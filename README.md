# ExtXYZ.jl

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/libAtoms/ExtXYZ.jl/CI.yml?branch=master) [![docs-dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://libAtoms.github.io/ExtXYZ.jl/dev) [![docs-stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-stable-blue.svg)](https://libatoms.github.io/ExtXYZ.jl/stable)

This package provides Julia bindings for the [extxyz](https://github.com/libAtoms/extxyz) C library which implements a parser and writer for the extended XYZ file format used in materials and molecular modelling, following the [specification](https://github.com/libAtoms/extxyz#extended-xyz-specification-and-parsing-tools) set out in the extxyz repo. Moreover the `ExtXYZ.Atoms` object directly adheres to the [AtomsBase](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) common interface for atomistic structures.

**Maintainer:** James Kermode ([@jameskermode](https://github.com/jameskermode)).

## Installation

This package is registered in the General registry, so installation of the latest stable release is as simple as pressing `]` to enter `pkg>` mode in the Julia REPL, and then entering:

```julia
pkg> add ExtXYZ
```

or for the development version:

```julia
pkg> dev https://github.com/libAtoms/ExtXYZ.jl
```

## Related packages

- The [JuLIP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/JuLIP.jl) package is an optional - but recommended - companion. JuLIP can use `ExtXYZ.jl` to read and write extended XYZ files to/from `JuLIP.Atoms` instances, using the functions `JuLIP.read_extxyz()` and `JuLIP.write_extxyz()`.
- The package is integrated with [AtomsIO.jl](https://github.com/mfherbst/AtomsIO.jl) to provide a uniform interface (based on [AtomsBase](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl)) for reading and writing a large range of atomistic structure files.

Please open issues/PRs here with suggestions of other packages it would be useful to provide interfaces to.

## Basic Usage

Four key functions are exported: `read_frame()` and `write_frame()` for reading and writing single configurations (snapshots), respectively, and `read_frames()` and `write_frames()` for reading and writing trajectories. Moreover `ExtXYZ.Atoms` provides a datastructure to expose the read configurations in an [AtomsBase](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl)-compatible manner.
All read and write functions can work with string filenames, an open `Base.IO` instance or (intended primarily for internal use) a C `FILE*` pointer, stored as a `Ptr{Cvoid}` type.

```julia
using ExtXYZ

frame = read_frame("input.xyz")  # single atomic configuration, represented as a Dict{String}{Any}
write_frame("output.xyz", frame) # write a single frame to `output.xyz`. 

frame10 = read_frame("input.xyz", 10) # read a specific frame, counting from 1 for first frame in file

all_frames = read_frames("seq.xyz")  # read all frames, returns Vector{Dict{String}{Any}}
frames = read_frames("seq.xyz", 1:4) # specific range of frames

write_frames("output.xyz", frames, append=true) # append four frames to output

# Get a frame as AtomsBase-compatible ExtXYZ.Atoms object:
Atoms(read_frame("input.xyz"))

# Get list of frames as AtomsBase-compatible ExtXYZ.Atoms object:
Atoms.(read_frames("seq.xyz", 1:4)
```

The function `iread_frames()` provides lazy file-reading using a `Channel`:

```julia
for frame in iread_frames("input.xyz")
    process(frame) # do something with each frame
do
```

`write_frames()` can also be used for asynchronous writing by passing in a `Channel`:

```julia
Channel() do ch
    @async write_frames(outfile, ch)
    
    for frame in frames
        put!(ch, frame)
    end
end
```

## Atoms data structure

In lieu of a package-independent data structure for representing atomic structures (i.e. an equivalent to ASE's `Atoms` class in the Python ecosystem), this package uses a `Dict{String}{Any}`. For the extended XYZ file:

```

Si        1.36000000      4.08000000      4.08000000

Important dictionary keys include:

 - `N_atoms` - the number of atoms (mandatory)
 - `cell` - the unit cell, a 3x3 matrix of floats containing the cell vectors as rows, i.e. the same as [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/cell.html#ase.cell.Cell) (mandatory)
 - `pbc` - periodic boundary conditions, `Vector{Bool}` of length 3 (optional)
 - `info` - dictionary containing per-configuration key/value pairs parsed from the comment (line #2 in each frame). These can include scalars, vectors and matrices of integer, real, bool and string scalars or vectors. (mandatory, can be empty)
 - `arrays` - dictionary containing per-atom properties as a `N_component x N_atoms` matrix, reduced to a vector for the case `N_component = 1`. These represent scalar (`N_component = 1`) or vector (`N_component > 1`) per-atom properties, of integer (`I`), real (`R`), bool, (`L`) or string (`S`, scalars only) type. The set of properties is extracted from the special `Properties` key in the comment line. (mandatory, and must contain at least a string property `"species"` containing atomic symbols and a 3-column vector property
