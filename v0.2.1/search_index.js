All functions can work with string filenames, an open Base.IO instance or (intended primarily for internal use) a C FILE* pointer, stored as a Ptr{Cvoid} type.\n\nusing ExtXYZ\n\nframe = read_frame(\"input.xyz\")  # single atomic configuration, represented as a Dict{String}{Any}\nwrite_frame(\"output.xyz\", frame) # write a single frame to `output.xyz`. \n\nframe10 = read_frame(\"input.xyz\", 10) # read a specific frame, counting from 1 for first frame in file\n\nall_frames = read_frames(\"seq.xyz\")  # read all frames, returns Vector{Dict{String}{Any}}\nframes = read_frames(\"seq.xyz\", 1:4) # specific range of frames\n\nwrite_frames(\"output.xyz\", frames, append=true) # append four frames to output\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Functions","page":"ExtXYZ.jl Documentation","title":"Functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"ExtXYZ.jl Documentation","title":"ExtXYZ.jl Documentation","text":"read_frame\nread_frames\niread_frames\nwrite_frame\nwrite_frames","category":"page"},{"location":"#ExtXYZ.read_frame","page":"ExtXYZ.jl Documentation","title":"ExtXYZ.read_frame","text":"read_frame(file)\n\nRead a single frame from the ExtXYZ file file, which can be a file pointer, an open IO stream, a string filename or an IOBuffer.\n\nReading from IOBuffers is currently not supported on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#ExtXYZ.read_frames","page":"ExtXYZ.jl Documentation","title":"ExtXYZ.read_frames","text":"read_frames(file[, range])\n\nRead a sequence of frames from the ExtXYZ file, which can be specified by a file pointer, filename, IOStream or IOBuffer.\n\nrange can be a single integer, range object or integer array of frame indices.\n\nReading from IOBuffers is currently not supported on Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#ExtXYZ.iread_frames","page":"ExtXYZ.jl Documentation","title":"ExtXYZ.iread_frames","text":"iread_frames(file[, range])\n\nReturn a Channel for reading from an ExtXYZ file.
